# RFDesign-Shapes

I am modifying the RFDesign code to include a loss function that rewards the protein structure fitting in a certain pre-defined space.  This is for designing a protein that forms a certain shape without knowing the internal structure ahead of time.

More details [here.](https://joseph-vineland.github.io/2022/07/21/Designing-proteins-of-a-certain-shape-without-knowing-the-specific-internal-structure-ahead-of-time.html)

This repository contains code for protein hallucination or inpainting, as
described in [our
preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.10.468128v2). Code
for postprocessing and analysis scripts included in `scripts/`.


## License

All code and neural network weights are open source under the BSD license. See `LICENSE`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
    git clone https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFDesign.git
    cd RFDesign
```

2. Create environment and install dependencies:

```
    cd envs
    conda env create -f SE3-nvidia.yml
```

3. Download weights (this step can be skipped if you downloaded the Zenodo version of this repo):
```
    cd hallucination/weights/rf_Nov05
    wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/rfdesign/weights/BFF_last.pt

    cd inpainting/weights/
    wget http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/rfdesign/weights/BFF_mix_epoch25.pt
```

4. Run tests
```
    cd hallucination/tests/
    ./run_tests.sh

    cd inpainting/tests/
    ./run_tests.sh
```
